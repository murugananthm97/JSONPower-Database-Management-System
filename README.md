# Web Database Management System
## Description :
 ### The Web Database Management System is a mini project done to store the data from a web page in a JsonPower Database by using AJAX, a browser's built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server), which uses JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data).
 JsonPowerDB is an RDBMS that makes it possible to work efficiently, effectively, and faster, which helps you keep an edge over competitors.
 It builds powerful data structures using C++, Java, and other core technologies to meet the requirements of generating fast, real-time information out of unmanaged, unexpected data explosions happening in the data industry.
 ## Benefits :
  - JSONPower DBMS has a database server with developer-friendly REST API services. It's a high-performance, light-weight, ajax-enabled, serverless, simple to use, real-time database.
 - It is easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server-side programming or scripting or without installing any kind of database.
 - Whether it's a dynamic website or a mobile app or some data analytics portal, the development is really fun and fast. There is nothing better than trying it yourself. All you need is a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
 - A Single Instance-Million Indexes It can support over a million indexed columns in a single instance spread across users and databases.
 - It is available as a shared environment or as an independent server on the Internet, Intranet, Extranet, or Cloud.
 ## Scope of Functionalities
 - GeoSpatial data is time-based data that is related to a specific location on the Earth's surface, providing insights into relationships between variables to reveal patterns and trends.
 - The PowerDrive Pluggable API is an all-in-one drive backend that is ready to use. It is easy to upload, download, and manage both binary and text files.
 - A Pluggable API Framework is a plugin New database features, commands, or customised APIs are seamlessly integrated into a running JsonPowerDB instance with zero downtime.
 - A REST-API Webservice is a database that is schema-free, easy to use, nimble, and in-memory.
